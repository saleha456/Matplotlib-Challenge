#### Pymaceuticals

This study looks at tumor volume data for mice being treated across 10 different drug regimens.  In this study, 249 mice were identified with a tumor growth and were treated through a variety of drug regimens. The tumor volume for each mouse was observed and measured over 45 days. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

This analysis provides the following information:

- General summary statistics that describe the central tendency of tumor volume data across each treatment regimen.
- The total amount of times the mice were tested for each drug regimen.
- Gender distribution of the mice.
- Determines if there are any outliers for four particular drugs of interest.
- Tumor volume over time for a particular mouse given Capomulin.
- The correlation between average tumor volume and mouse weight for each mouse given Capomulin.
